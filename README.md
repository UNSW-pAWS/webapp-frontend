## User Guide

The application is based on a simple drag-and-drop functionality. The resources represent the AWS instances and services that make up the system. The connections represent the data flows or linkages between the instances.

Basic functionality and usage is outlined below.

### Adding and Removing Resources

To add resources, drag a resource tile from the asset bar on the left onto the canvas.

### Adding and Removing Connections

To add a connection, hover over the starting resource so that the connection handlers appear. Then, drag one of the handlers over to the ending resource and drop it. A connection should appear between the two resources.

### Using the Dependency Checker Tool

The Dependency Checker Tool is available for Compute resources in the Configuration Panel. Users can enter the names of the packages to be checked as well as the depth of the dependency tree that they wish to check up to. Multiple packages can be searched by entering names in the format `PackageName1, PackageName2, PackageName3...` Results will then be listed in the panel.
